## 🎮 How the Game Works

* **Batting:**
  Enter a number (1–6).
  If your number matches the bowler → **you’re out**.
  Otherwise → you score that many runs.

* **Bowling:**
  Enter a number (1–6).
  If it matches the computer’s shot → **wicket**.
  Otherwise → computer scores.

* **In a chase:**
  You’ll see the required runs and remaining balls every ball.

Game ends when:

* Overs run out
* All wickets fall
* Or the target is chased

A final match summary displays the outcome.
